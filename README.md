Questions:
1. How long did you spend on the test?
- I spend 3 full 3 days (Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday).
There were some unforeseen events that didn't let me evolve.

2. What would you add if you had more time?
- Well, I just made a basic structure. The features and configuration of the swagger in docker are missing, after that I would create the front end

3. How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?
- Documenting with OpenAPi would already be a good improvement

4. What did you find most difficult?
- When creating the cloud environment with spring boot, I had some version incompatibility setbacks (Cucumber, OpenApi/Swagger). I had to give up on Cucumber.

5. How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us? 
- I feel embarrassed for delivering so little, but I believe that in general the structure of the project was good, with some adjustments still needed.
- I love this kind of challenges, I think I get lost in time, trying to create something that is not the main focus (as it was in this case).
